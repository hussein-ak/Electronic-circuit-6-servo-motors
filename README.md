## Procedure
### step1 : Assemble hardware components
An Arduino Uno R3, breadboard, six servo motors, and a 6V power supply (four 1.5V AA batteries) have been installed and connected.
### step2 : Arrange servo motors
The six servo motors have been precisely aligned side by side, ensuring optimal positioning for clear and efficient connections in the circuit.
### step 3 : Power setup and servo connections
The 4 AA batteries (6V total) are wired to the breadboard's power rails. Then, each of the 6 servo motors is connected to these rails:

Battery positive → Breadboard (+) rail → Servo positive pins
Battery negative → Breadboard (-) rail → Servo negative pins
This powers all servos uniformly from the central supply.
### step 4 : Connect servo signals and add measurements
Wire each servo's signal pin to Arduino Uno R3 PWM pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11). 

Additional setup:
• Voltmeter across Servo3 for voltage reading
• Ammeter in series with Servo3 for current measurement

These instruments allow monitoring of Servo3's electrical parameters.
